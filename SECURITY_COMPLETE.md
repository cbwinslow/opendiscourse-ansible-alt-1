   ```

2. **Run security hardening:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./secure_server.sh
   ```

### Remote Deployment
1. **From your local machine:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy_security.sh
   # Enter your server IP when prompted
   ```

### Ansible Deployment
1. **Configure inventory:**
   - Edit `ansible/inventory/hetzner.ini`
   - Add your server details

2. **Deploy with Ansible:**
   ```bash

2. **Run the rescue script:**
   ```bash
   ./rescue_restore_access.sh
   ```
3. **Reboot into normal mode**
4. **Connect with emergency user:**
   ```bash
   ssh emergency@YOUR_SERVER_IP
   ```

### Emergency Users
- **emergency** - Password: `emergency123`
- **backup** - Password: `backup123`
- Both have sudo access and are always included in SSH AllowUsers

### Critical Files
- **Emergency restore:** `/root/emergency_restore.sh`
- **SSH config backup:** `/opt/security-backups/`
- **Security logs:** `/var/log/security_*.log`

## 📊 Monitoring Automation

### Automated Reports
- **Daily security report:** 6 AM daily
- **Hourly incident checks:** Every hour
- **Log rotation:** Automatic cleanup

### Log Locations
- **Daily reports:** `/var/log/daily_security_report.log`
- **Security incidents:** `/var/log/security_incidents.log`
- **Ansible deployments:** `/var/log/ansible_security_*.log`

## 🎯 Key Lessons Learned

1. **Always include emergency users in SSH AllowUsers** - This was the critical fix
2. **Test security changes incrementally** - Don't apply all at once
3. **Maintain multiple access methods** - Password + key authentication
4. **Automate monitoring** - Catch issues before they become lockouts
5. **Document everything** - Know how to recover quickly

## ✅ Success Metrics

- ✅ Server lockout resolved
- ✅ Emergency access established
- ✅ Comprehensive security hardening deployed
- ✅ Monitoring automation implemented
- ✅ Recovery procedures documented
- ✅ Future lockout prevention measures in place
